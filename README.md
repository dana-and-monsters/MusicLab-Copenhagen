# MusicLab-Copenhagen
MusicLab Copenhagen survey analysis

During the Welcome (back) party, RITMO and IMV staff used the MusicLab app to record their motion and survey responses. The musicians were also invited to participate and indicated their musician status in the survey. This data is only to be used for internal analyses and will not be published anywhere. The scripts herein are the first draft for what will be collected at the music lab copenhagen concert.

No one replied to my request for feedback after the concert.

During the concert, one person reported receiving an error message:
	- Iphone 8 error sending data (guitarist)
	
Another participant came forward with a concern:
	- Galaxy s10e shows the app still running in background after app was closed (most recent Android version Aug 24) (it gave this pilot articipant some anxiety)

Motion data was dancing from one song. Participants were told to press record at the first sound they heard. We did not record the music. Participants pressed stop capture after the song and filled out the outro survey after the song. 

The outro survey was as follows:
